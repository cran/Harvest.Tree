Description: Aimed at applying the Harvest classification tree algorithm, modified algorithm of classic classification tree.The harvested tree has advantage of deleting redundant rules in trees, leading to a simplify and more efficient tree model.It was firstly used in drug discovery field, but it also performs well in other kinds of data, especially when the region of a class is disconnected. This package also improves the basic harvest classification tree algorithm by extending the field of data of algorithm to both continuous and categorical variables.
